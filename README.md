# wcrp_generalrobbery_kw
General store robbery for RedM


Credits to WCRP // Perry // Wizard Neo

add ensure wcrp_generalrobbery_kw to your server.cfg

This edit adds the ability to rob general stores that is listed in the config.lua as well as runs the lockpicking timer and police alert through the config in miliseconds.
This edit also adds rng to what items you get and money as such please add the specific items you want to recieve into your db as well as in the config.lua under config.items. You can change the payout on the server.lua: randommoney = math.random(50,250)

The SQL file given has the items I use and is also in the config.lua.


*Known issues:*
As of rn, you can hit G at the cash register and run away and still get paid.
You don't get notified properly of what you got but still recieve the items.
No cooldowns.

If you need help, join my discord, I run a RedM server that is in development and can provide support as well and future releases.
